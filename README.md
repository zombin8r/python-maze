# python-maze
Hello, I have created a first person maze game all in python.
I have used John Zelle's graphics library (version 5.0) which can be found at http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/
Just place the file where python can see it.
There are 3 simple movement keys which are 'w' which moves you forward, 'a' which turns you left, and 'd' which turns you right.
There is a cheat for the reference map which is 'C'(hold shift + c).
There is also a quit feature which just closes the program which is 'Q'(hold shift + q).
Thank you for giving my project the light of day and give me any criticism to help improve my code!
